    "### 2.1 What are the chances?\n",
    "\n",
    "People talk about chance pretty frequently, like what are the chances of closing a sale, of rain tomorrow, or of winning a game? But how exactly do we measure chance? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring chance\n",
    "\n",
    "We can measure the chances of an event using probability. We can calculate the probability of some event by taking the number of ways the event can happen and dividing it by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if we flip a coin, it can land on either heads or tails. To get the probability of the coin landing on heads, we divide the 1 way to get heads by the two possible outcomes, heads and tails. This gives us one half, or a fifty percent chance of getting heads. Probability is always between zero and 100 percent. If the probability of something is zero, it's impossible, and if the probability of something is 100%, it will certainly happen. \n",

    "### Assigning salespeople\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a more complex scenario. There's a meeting coming up with a potential client, and we want to send someone from the sales team to the meeting. We'll put each person's name on a ticket in a box and pull one out randomly to decide who goes to the meeting. Brian's name gets pulled out. The probability of Brian being selected is one out of four, or 25%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling from a DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "We can recreate this scenario in Python using the sample() method. By default, it randomly samples one row from the DataFrame. However, if we run the same thing again, we may get a different row since the sample method chooses randomly. If we want to show the team how we picked Brian, this won't work well. "

    "### 2.2 Discrete Distributions \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll take a deeper dive into probability and begin looking at probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling the dice\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider rolling a standard, six-sided die. There are six numbers, or six possible outcomes, and every number has one sixth, or about a 17 percent chance of being rolled. This is an example of a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing salespeople\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the scenario from earlier, except we had names instead of numbers. Just like rolling a die, each outcome, or name, had an equal chance of being chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution describes the probability of each possible outcome in a scenario. We can also talk about the expected value of a distribution, which is the mean of a distribution. We can calculate this by multiplying each value by its probability (one sixth in this case) and summing, so the expected value of rolling a fair die is 3-point-5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability = area \n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate probabilities of different outcomes by taking areas of the probability distribution. For example, what's the probability that our die roll is less than or equal to 2? To figure this out, we'll take the area of each bar representing an outcome of 2 or less. Each bar has a width of 1 and a height of one sixth, so the area of each bar is one sixth. We'll sum the areas for 1 and 2, to get a total probability of one third.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uneven die\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say we have a die where the two got turned into a three. This means that we now have a 0% chance of getting a 2, and a 33% chance of getting a 3. To calculate the expected value of this die, we now multiply 2 by 0, since it's impossible to get a 2, and 3 by its new probability, one third. This gives us an expected value that's slightly higher than the fair die. \n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete probability distributions \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distributions you've seen so far are both discrete probability distributions, since they represent situations with discrete outcomes. Recall from chapter 1 that discrete variables can be thought of as counted variables. In the case of a die, we're counting dots, so we can't roll a 1-point-5 or 4-point-3. When all outcomes have the same probability, like a fair die, this is a special distribution called a discrete uniform distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling with discrete distributions \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we sampled names from a box, we can do the same thing with probability distributions like the ones we've seen. Here's a DataFrame called die that represents a fair die, and its expected value is 3-point-5. We'll sample from it 10 times to simulate 10 rolls. Notice that we sample with replacement so that we're sampling from the same distribution every time. "

    "### Continuous Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use discrete distributions to model situations that involve discrete or countable variables, but how can we model continuous variables? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an example. The city bus arrives once every twelve minutes, so if you show up at a random time, you could wait anywhere from 0 minutes if you just arrive as the bus pulls in, up to 12 minutes if you arrive just as the bus leaves. Let's model this scenario with a probability distribution. There are an infinite number of minutes we could wait since we could wait 1 minute, 1-point-5 minutes, 1-point-53 minutes, and so on, so we can't create individual blocks like we could with a discrete variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Probability still = area\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our distribution, let's figure out what the probability is that we'll wait between 4 and 7 minutes. Just like with discrete distributions, we can take the area from 4 to 7 to calculate probability. The width of this rectangle is 7 minus 4 which is 3. The height is one twelfth. Multiplying those together to get area, we get 3/12 or 25%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the uniform distribution in Python to calculate the probability of waiting 7 minutes or less. We need to import uniform from scipy-dot-stats. We can call uniform-dot-cdf and pass it 7, followed by the lower and upper limits, which in our case is 0 and 12. The probability of waiting less than 7 minutes is about 58%. If we want the probability of waiting more than 7 minutes, we need to take 1 minus the probability of waiting less than 7 minutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we calculate the probability of waiting 4 to 7 minutes using Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "We can start with the probability of waiting less than 7 minutes, then subtract the probability of waiting less than 4 minutes. This gives us 25%. To calculate the probability of waiting between 0 and 12 minutes, we multiply 12 by 1/12, which is 1, or 100%. This makes sense since we're certain we'll wait anywhere from 0 to 12 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating random numbers according to uniform distribution\n",
    "\n",

    "It's time to further expand your toolbox of distributions. In this video, you'll learn about the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coin flipping\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by flipping a coin, which has two possible outcomes, heads or tails, each with a probability of 50%. This is just one example of a binary outcome, or an outcome with two possible values. We could also represent these outcomes as a 1 and a 0, a success or a failure, and a win or a loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can simulate this by importing binom from scipy-dot-stats and using the binom-dot-rvs function, which takes in the number of coins we want to flip, the probability of heads or success, and an argument called size, which is number of trials. size is a named argument, so we'll need to explicitly specify that the third argument corresponds to size, or we'll get incorrect results. This call will return a 1, which we'll count as a head, or a 0, which we'll count as tails. We can use binom-dot-rvs 1, 0-point-5, size equals 1 to flip 1 coin, with a 50% probability of heads, 1 time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform eight coin flips, we can change the size argument to 8, which will flip 1 coin with a 50% chance of heads 8 times. This gives us a set of 8 ones and zeros. If we swap the first and last arguments, we flip eight coins one time. This gives us one number, which is the total number of heads or successes. Similarly, we can pass 3 as the first argument, and set size equal to 10 to flip 3 coins. This returns 10 numbers, each representing the total number of heads from each set of flips."

    "We could also have a coin that's heavier on one side than the other, so the probability of getting heads is only 25%. To simulate flips with this coin, we'll adjust the second argument of binom-dot-rvs to 0-point-25. The result has lower numbers, since getting multiple heads isn't as likely with the new coin."

    "The binomial distribution describes the probability of the number of successes in a sequence of independent trials. In other words, it can tell us the probability of getting some number of heads in a sequence of coin flips. Note that this is a discrete distribution since we're working with a countable outcome. The binomial distribution can be described using two parameters, n and p. n represents the total number of trials being performed, and p is the probability of success. n and p are also the third and second arguments of binom-dot-rvs. Here's what the distribution looks like for 10 coins. We have the biggest chance of getting 5 heads total, and a much smaller chance of getting 0 heads or 10 heads. \n",

    "What's the probability of 7 heads?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the probability of getting 7 heads out of 10 coins, we can use binom-dot-pmf. The first argument is the number of heads or successes. The second argument is the number of trials, n, and the third is the probability of success, p. If we flip 10 coins, there's about a 12% chance that exactly 7 of them will be heads. "

For example, if we're picking randomly from these cards with zeros and ones, we have a 50-50 chance of getting a 0 or a 1. But since we're sampling without replacement, the probabilities for the second trial are different due to the outcome of the first trial. Since these trials aren't independent, we can't calculate accurate probabilities for this situation using the binomial distribution. \n",
