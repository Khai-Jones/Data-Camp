    "We'll now talk about the idea of scope in the context of user-defined functions. You've been defining variables in your programs and so far, you've been using these variables without any problems. However, one thing you should know is that not all objects that you define are always accessible everywhere in a program. Enter the idea of scope, which tells you which part of a program an object or a name may be accessed. Names refer to the variables or, more generally, objects such as functions that are defined in your program, for example, a variable x has a name, as does the function sum. There are three types of scope that you should know. The first one is the idea of the **global scope**. A name that is in the global scope means that it is defined in the main body of a script or a Python program. The second one, is the **local scope**. A name that is in a local scope means that it is defined within a function. Once the execution of a function is done, any name inside the local scope ceases to exist, which means you cannot access those names anymore outside of the function definition. The third is something called the **built-in scope**: this consists of names in the pre-defined built-ins module Python provides, such as print and sum. You'll play around with the built-ins module in the interactive exercises. "

    "Let's now look at another important use case of nested functions. In this example, we define a function raise_vals, which contains an inner function called inner. Now look at what raise_vals returns: it returns the inner function inner! raise_vals takes an argument n and creates a function inner that returns the nth power of any number. That's a bit complicated and will be clearer when we use the function raise_vals. Passing the number 2 to raise_vals creates a function that squares any number. Similarly, passing the number 3 to raise_vals creates a function that cubes any number. One interesting detail: when we call the function square, it remembers the value n=2, although the enclosing scope defined by raise_val and to which n=2 is local, has finished execution. This is a subtlety referred to as a closure in Computer Science circles and shouldn't concern you too much. It is worth mentioning, however, as you may encounter it out there in the wild. "
